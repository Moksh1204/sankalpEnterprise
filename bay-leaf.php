                            <p>Bay leaves, sourced from the Laurus nobilis tree, are an essential whole spice known for their subtle aroma and slightly bitter, herbal taste. Commonly added to curries, soups, biryanis, and stews, these leaves enrich recipes with depth and fragrance while balancing flavors in slow-cooked dishes.</p>
                            <br><p>Beyond their culinary role, bay leaves offer impressive health benefits. They are rich in vitamins A, C, and B6, along with minerals such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. Regular use may support digestion, immunity, and heart health, making bay leaves both a flavorful and nutritious addition to everyday cooking.</p>
